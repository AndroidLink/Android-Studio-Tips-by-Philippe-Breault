The live template is a way to quickly insert a snippet of code. The interesting thing with live templates is that they can be parameterized with sensible defaults and guide you through the parameters when you insert it.

**Additional Tip**: You don't need to invoke the shortcut if you know the abbreviation. You only need to type it and complete using the Tab key.

Shortcut: 

 - Mac: `Cmd+J`
 - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Jï»¿`
