The idea here is to show an outline of the current class and navigate in it. The best thing about it is that you can filter using your keyboard. This is a very efficient way to go to a method you know by name.

Additional tips:

 - You can use camel-case matching when typing to filter the list. Example: typing "oCr" would find "onCreate"
 - You can toggle a checkbox to also show anonymous classes. It could be useful in some cases like if you want to go directly to the onClick method in an OnClickListener.﻿

OSX: `cmd+f12`
Windows/Linux: `ctrl+f12`
Other Keymap: Look up the shortcut to the right of this menu: *Navigate* → *File Structure*
