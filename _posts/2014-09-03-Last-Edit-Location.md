This will make you navigate through the last changes you made. 
This is different from clicking the back arrow in the toolbar in that it makes you travel within your edition history and not your navigation history.

Shortcut:  

 - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+Backspace`
 - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl-Shift-Backspaceï»¿`
