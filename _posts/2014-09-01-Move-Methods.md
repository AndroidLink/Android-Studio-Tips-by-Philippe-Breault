This is like the Move Line shortcut but applied to whole methods.
It allows you to move a method below or above another one without copy-pasting.

The real name of this action is Move Statement. Meaning that it moves any kind of statement. E.g. you can reorder fields and inner classes. However, I found that moving method is pretty much its only day-to-day use

Shortcut:

- Mac: `Cmd+Alt+Up / Cmd+Alt+Down`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl-Shift-Up / Ctrl-Shift-Down`
