You can invoke any menu or action known to Android Studio by its name! This is pretty useful for commands that you use once in a while but don't have a shortcut for.

**Additional tip**: If there is a shortcut associated to the action, it will be shown by its sideï»¿

Shortcut: `cmd+shift+a` (mac) or `ctrl+shift+a` (windows/linux)
