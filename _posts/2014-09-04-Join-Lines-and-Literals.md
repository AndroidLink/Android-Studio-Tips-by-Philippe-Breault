This is doing more than simulating the delete key at the end of the line!
It will preserve formatting rules and it will also:

  - Merge two comment lines and remove the unused //
  - Merge multiline strings, removing the + signs and the double-quotes
  - Join fields and assignments

**Additional Tip**: If you select a string that spans multiple lines, it will merge it on a single one.

Shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+Jï»¿`
