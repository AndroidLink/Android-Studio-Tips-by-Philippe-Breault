Takes the current file and asks you where to select it.
The most useful shortcuts IMHO are to open in the project structure or in your file explorer.

Note that each action is prefixed by a number or a letter, this is the shortcut to invoke it quickly.

Usually, I'll go `Alt+F1` then `Enter` to open in the project view and `Alt+F1+` to reveal the file in Finder on the Mac.

You can invoke this from a file or directly from the project view.

Shortcut: `Alt+F1ï»¿`
