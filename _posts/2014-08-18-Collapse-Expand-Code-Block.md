Menu: *Code* → *Folding* → *Expand/Collapse*

The goal of this feature is to let you hide things you don't care about at the moment.
In its simplest form, it will hide a whole code block (e.g. ignoring the import list when you open a new file). A more interesting use is that it will hide the boilerplate around simple anonymous inner classes and make it look like a lambda expression.

**Additional tip**: You can setup the default folding behaviour in the preferences at *Editor* → *Code Folding﻿*

Shortcut: `cmd+plus/minus` (mac) or `ctrl+shift+plus/minus` (windows/linux)
