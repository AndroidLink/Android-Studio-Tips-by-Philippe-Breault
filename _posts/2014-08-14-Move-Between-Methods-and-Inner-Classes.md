Look up the shortcut to the right of these menus: *Navigate* → *Next Method and Navigate* → *Previous Method*
Chances are that it will be `ctrl+up/down` on a Mac and `alt+up/down` on Windows and Linux.

This wil move your cursor to the name of the next method or class in the current file.

Additional tip:

 - If you are in the body of a method, going up will put the cursor on its name. This can be very useful because it puts you at the right place to refactor or find the usages of this method.﻿
