This will generate the missing code to complete a statement
The usual use cases are:

  - Add a semicolon at the end of the line, even if you are not at the end of the line
  - Add the parentheses and curly braces after an if, while or for
  - Add the curly braces after a method declaration

Additional Tip:

 - If a statement is already completed, it will go to the next line even if you are not at the last character of the current line.

Shortcut: 

 - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+Enter`
 - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl-Shift-Enterï»¿`
